- **Route Calculation**: Generates Google Maps directions URLs with parameters:
  - `driving` = `3e0`
  - `walking` = `3e2`
  - `bicycling` = `3e1`
  - `transit` = `3e3`

### JavaScript Functionality

## Usage

### Creating Pages in WordPress

1. Create a new page in WordPress admin
2. Set the page template to "Directions - German" or "Directions - English"
3. Publish the page

### URL Structure

- German: `/anfahrt/` (recommended)
- English: `/directions/` (recommended)

### Customizer Settings Required

The pages use the following customizer settings:

- Practice name
- Street address
- City and country
- Phone number
- Google My Business name (optional, for enhanced accuracy)
- Map display toggle

**Note**: The Google Maps iframe URL is now automatically generated from your address and Google My Business name, so manual URL management is no longer required.

## Styling

### Design Features

- Responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2 columns on desktop)
- Modern card-based design with shadows and rounded corners
- Consistent color scheme using theme colors
- Hover effects and transitions
- Icon-based information display

### Color Scheme

- Primary: Blue (#3B82F6) for maps and links
- Secondary: Green (#10B981) for directions
- Accent: Emerald gradient for buttons
- Background: Gray gradient for page background

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Features

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices

### Fallbacks

- Map placeholder when iframe fails to load
- Graceful degradation for JavaScript-disabled browsers

## SEO Considerations

### Structured Data

- Address information is properly structured
- Contact information follows schema.org guidelines
- Accessible markup for screen readers

### Performance

- Lazy loading for Google Maps iframe
- Optimized images and icons
- Minimal JavaScript footprint

## Maintenance

### Updates Required

- Address information in customizer (automatically updates all maps)

**Note**: Maps now update automatically when you change your address or business name - no manual URL updates required.

### Monitoring

- Verify route calculation URLs work correctly
- Test on different devices and browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map not displaying**: Check iframe URL in customizer
2. **Route calculation not working**: Verify JavaScript is enabled
3. **Address not showing**: Check customizer contact settings

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify customizer settings are saved
3. Test Google Maps URLs manually
4. Check iframe permissions and loading
